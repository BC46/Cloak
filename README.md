# Cloak
Plugin for the game Freelancer (2003) that implements the Cloak key. This allows players to cloak and decloak in Single Player, provided the ship has a cloaking device equipped.

## Installation instructions
Download the latest `Cloak.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/BC46/Cloak/releases). Extract the `dll` to the `EXE` folder of your Freelancer installation. Next, open the `dacom.ini` file and append `Cloak.dll` to the `[Libraries]` section.

## Usage instructions

## Build instructions
Build the project using the `NMAKE` tool from Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (VC6 or Visual Studio 98) with the included makefile.
This will output the `Cloak.dll` file in the `bin` folder.
Building the project using other compilers may require the code to be modified.
